meet
====

Framework for instant conference meets with locations and user responses. It demonstrates the principle of using a modern, instantly updating framework for helping to organize meetings and conferences.

It is a fork of Meteor's Party App example https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/examples/parties

This can be the basis of a new open-source project.

Future possible enhancements:

* Administration view - edit its database, etc.
* Replace double-click behavior for touch devices
* LinkedIn / Google Plus logins and avatars
* Rich text in the meetsâ€™ descriptions
* Improved responsiveness in all browser sizes and orientations
* Text labels / logos for the meet icons
* Enhanced CRUD database functions for meets
* Calendar / time integration
* Changeable background maps
* Display warning if not JavaScript not on
* Add more mobile features like geolocation, wayfinding, and notifications
